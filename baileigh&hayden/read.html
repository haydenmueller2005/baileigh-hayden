            <p>Hii Baileigh. I hope you are reading this last after youve seen all the other pages. If you are I really hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it. I cannot believe that we have been together for almost 4 months now.
                Time with you feels like it goes by so fast. I still remember the first day that we met and how happy i was to talk to you. I knew when I first layed my eyes on you that you were the one that I wanted. Even though I kinda had 
                a really corny pickup line it still worked. Im so glad that I said those things because somehow it worked and here we are. We have made so much memories together and I cant wait to make more with you. I love you so much baileigh 
                I know sometimes I dont show it and sometimes you might not feel like I do, But I really do and I appreciate everything you do for me. You make me so happy and you make every moment so enjoyable, I love everything about you. Your
                warm presence, your sweet embrace, how your eyes look like planets, how you make me feel reassured, your beautiful face, your soft and delicate hair, your perfect and amazing body, your soft and welcoming voice, how welcome you make
                me feel. Every single thing about you is perfect and I love every single aspect of you physically and non-physically. I know that we are going through a tough time right now but I can promise you it wont be forever and we will work 
                this out, no matter what happens I will always be here and always be willing to work things out. I dont know a single other person that I would rather spend the rest of my life with. You mean everything to me and you are my world. 
                I cant wait to grow old with you and travel the world and maybe even one day have children and have mini yous running around. I KNOW that you are the only one that I want and you are the only one that I need. So please never feel 
                like you arent enough because you are, you are perfect just how you are so please never change. I love you so fucking much baileigh and I always will.
            </p>

          <h1>June 8th, 2023</h1>
          <p>This is what started it all, I never would have thought that us just playing minecraft together would lead us to where we are now but here we are. I think us playing games together is what got us so close, its one of my favorite hobbies and Ive always loved playing them, and having someone that I can play with them that I truly love and care about is everything to me. I can still remember every moment of this day and im so glad that we got to play together.</p>

          <h1>July 11th, 2023</h1>
          <p>This is when I first asked you out to be my girlfriend. I remember spending so much time preparing it and I just wanted to finish it as soon as I could because I really wanted to ask you out and for you to be mine, Im so glad that I did ask you out and it was the best decision ive ever made in my life. Im so grateful for you and I dont know what i would do without you.</p>

          <h1>Omegle</h1>
          <p>This was one of your favorite activies to do together. I never really understood why but I enjoyed doing it as long as I was with you. I loved pranking people or just messing with people and seeing your reaction and I always love hearing your cute laugh. I finally figured out why you like when I go on Omegle and it was because you could sneak some photos of me, when you told me that I thought it was so cute.</p>
